JARVIS is a Python-based voice assistant that listens to your commands, speaks responses, and performs tasks like telling the time, searching the web, opening apps, playing music, checking battery status, and more. It uses SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, and psutil, with optional offline mode via Vosk.
